Architecture
-------------

ORM is necessary if we want to allow plugin authors storage.

What are we trying to make?

An issue tracker or a BPM tool.

I want to do regular coding everyday for 1 hr atleast.

Rust
Diesel
Postgres (Write DB, replicated to ES)
ElasticSearch (for Views/search/filters)
Actixrs


Design the application as a container in which all features run as a plugins aka Redmine?
